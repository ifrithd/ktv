I wanna know
Who ever told you I was letting go
Of the only joy that I have ever known
Girl they were lying
Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know
Have just given up they wanna let it go
But we're still trying
So you should know this love we share
Was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one-way street
Just you and I
Just you and I
